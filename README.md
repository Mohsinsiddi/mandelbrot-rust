# Mandelbrot Fractal Renderer in Rust

This project is a multithreaded Mandelbrot fractal renderer built using Rust. It showcases Rust's concurrency and memory safety features while rendering complex fractals in real-time.

## Features

- Multithreaded rendering using `Arc` and `Mutex`
- Colorful visualization of the Mandelbrot set
- Lightweight graphical window using the `minifb` crate
- Efficient computation split across multiple threads

## Prerequisites

- **Rust**: Ensure you have Rust installed on your machine. You can install it by following the instructions at [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).
- **Cargo**: Cargo comes bundled with Rust. It is the package manager and build system for Rust projects.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mohsinsiddi/mandelbrot-rust.git
   cd mandelbrot-rust
   ```
````

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd mandelbrot-rust
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**: Run the following command to fetch the required dependencies.

   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

## Running the Project

To run the Mandelbrot fractal renderer, use the following command:

```bash
cargo run
```

### Controls

- **ESC**: Exit the application.

## System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **RAM**: At least 2 GB recommended.
- **CPU**: Multicore processor for optimal performance.

## Exploring the Power of Rust

This project highlights Rust's strengths in several ways:

- **Concurrency**: The use of threads allows for parallel processing, significantly speeding up the rendering of the fractal.
- **Memory Safety**: Rust's ownership model ensures that memory is handled safely, preventing data races and corruption even in a multithreaded context.
- **Performance**: Rust is designed for high performance, making it suitable for compute-intensive tasks like fractal rendering.

## Potential Use Cases

- **Educational Tools**: Great for teaching fractal geometry, multithreading, and performance optimization.
- **Visualization**: Can be used in scientific research, simulations, or artistic projects involving fractals.
- **Game Development**: Explore procedural generation techniques for textures and landscapes.
